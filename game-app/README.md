# Click - n - Switch Game

A memory game constructed with React.  A set of 12 game cards are displayed on the screen.  The user plays the game by clicking on each card, with the goal of not clicking more than once on any game card.  After each click the cards are shuffled.  THe player earns a point for every card that they select that has not been previously selected.  If a card is selected more than once, the game is over, and the score resets to zero.
